# SimpleAutoClicker
Why do we need to buy an autoclicker application while we can build one. This is a very simple autoclicker app runs on Windows. We will fix bug and update more features.

- Go to here to run the AutoClick.exe: SimpleAutoClicker\bin\Debug\net5.0-windows.
- Go to here to open the code and fix and update (up to you): SimpleAutoClicker\AutoClick.sln

Second(s): how many second between each click
Total click(s): how many click you want to.
Current clicks count: what is the current click at the time you are looking at it.
A hidden start/stop time will pop up when you hit the START button.

Bugs: 
- Click won't pause while the mouse is moving
- The form should be fixed size (not resizeable)

Feature:
- PAUSE button has not intergated yet.
- Calculate the total time or estimate time to perform the click from start to stop
- Click close form button (X button) should pop up a confirmation. To prevent accidentaly hitting close the form unintentionally.
