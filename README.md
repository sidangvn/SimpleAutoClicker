# SimpleAutoClicker
Why do we need to buy an autoclicker application while we can build one. This is a very simple autoclicker app runs on Windows. We will fix bug and update more features.

- Go to here to run the AutoClick.exe: SimpleAutoClicker\bin\Debug\net5.0-windows.
- Go to here to open the code and fix and update (up to you): SimpleAutoClicker\AutoClick.sln
